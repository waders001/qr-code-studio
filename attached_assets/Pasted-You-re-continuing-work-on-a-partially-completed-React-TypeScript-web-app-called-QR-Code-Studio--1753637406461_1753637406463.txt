You're continuing work on a partially completed React + TypeScript web app called **QR Code Studio**. It has a premium dark UI with glassmorphism, but many parts are non-functional or broken.

---

‚úÖ PRIMARY GOAL:
Fix QR rendering and make the full QR generation flow work from input ‚Üí preview ‚Üí customization ‚Üí export ‚Üí share.

---

üõ† CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:

1. **QR Code Preview is Broken**
   - QR canvas renders incorrect/incomplete matrix (especially for short text like "H")
   - Fix or replace current `qr-generator.ts` logic with a reliable library like `qrcode-generator` or `qr-code-styling`
   - Make QR visually accurate and scannable

2. **Live Preview Fails to Update**
   - Ensure preview updates when content type, text, colors, or overlays are changed
   - Fix state propagation from form to QRPreview component

3. **Customization Panel Doesn‚Äôt Apply Settings**
   - Foreground and background color pickers are not applying styles to QR
   - Logo uploads and presets (‚≠ê, ‚ù§Ô∏è) are not reflected in preview
   - Text overlay does not show under QR

4. **Export Buttons (PNG/SVG) Are Non-Functional**
   - Implement PNG and SVG export using canvas or QR library methods
   - Trigger download with correct file name

5. **Share Link Creation Is Incomplete**
   - Button should:
     - Serialize QR config
     - Save to localStorage or backend with a unique ID
     - Generate a URL like `/share/:id`
     - Copy to clipboard and show success toast
   - Shared page should render QR with same config and styling

üåü BONUS POLISH:

- Add onboarding tutorial (optional: floating tooltip or slide-in steps)
- Improve layout responsiveness on mobile
- Save QR history using IndexedDB or localStorage
- Improve theme toggle (icon + persistent)
- Fix all accessibility issues (aria labels, keyboard nav)
- Animate share button and transitions
- Add capacity limits per QR version and show warnings

‚úçÔ∏è Final Notes:
Keep everything modular, error-handled, and TypeScript-safe. Make sure app works fully for content types: `Text`, `URL`, `Contact`, `WiFi`, `Phone`, `Email`, `SMS`.

Continue using Tailwind classes or custom CSS for styling, and clean up console logs. Focus on real functionality ‚Äî not just looks.
