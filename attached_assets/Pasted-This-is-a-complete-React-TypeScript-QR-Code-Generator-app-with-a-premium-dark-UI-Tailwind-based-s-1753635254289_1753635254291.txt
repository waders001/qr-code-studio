This is a complete React + TypeScript QR Code Generator app with a premium dark UI, Tailwind-based styling, and custom canvas-based QR rendering (no external libraries). The project is version-controlled and saved as `v1.0.0`.

âœ… Whatâ€™s already implemented:
- Custom QR types (text, URL, contact, WiFi, email, phone, SMS)
- PNG + SVG export
- IndexedDB-based history
- Analytics dashboard
- Live preview with canvas drawing
- Full responsive layout and dark theme
- Deployed folder structure with `client`, `server`, and `shared` logic

ðŸ“¦ Next I want to implement and polish multiple features together. Please do the following in this current project context:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Shareable QR Links**
- When a QR is saved, generate a short UUID
- Store its data in a backend route (`/api/qr/:id`) using the current Express server
- Add a `/qr/:id` route in the frontend that loads the saved data and regenerates the QR code
- Add a "Copy public link" button next to "Download"

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Mobile Responsiveness Polish**
- Improve spacing, stacking, and font sizes on mobile
- Ensure the canvas resizes to fit smaller viewports without distortion
- Convert multi-column form layouts into stacked single-column on small screens

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **"Scan Me" Logo Overlay (Optional)**
- Add the ability to upload a logo image to overlay at the center of the QR code
- Ensure it appears on the canvas and respects size limits
- Allow toggling visibility or using built-in icons

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Animated Transitions**
- Add subtle fade/scale-in animations for major sections using Tailwind or Framer Motion
- Animate the canvas when a QR code is generated (shimmer, pulse, or glow)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Deploy Preview Mode**
- Add a lightweight `/preview` route or component to render a single QR in a clean full-page layout for public sharing
- Remove UI controls and focus on the QR + metadata
- Mobile-optimized view

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Optional: Future Features Boilerplate**
Add placeholders/components for:
- Account login (OAuth or anonymous ID)
- Sync QR history to a Supabase/Cloud DB
- QR template themes (e.g. neon, classic, paper)

---

ðŸ’¡ Guidelines:
- Maintain React best practices
- Avoid external dependencies unless justified (can use `uuid`, `framer-motion`)
- Keep Tailwind classes organized
- Use the existing `QRCodeGenerator` logic and do not replace canvas drawing
- Work incrementally with full UI/logic, not just stubs

---

Return all modified and added files clearly. Preserve current functionality while extending and polishing the app.
