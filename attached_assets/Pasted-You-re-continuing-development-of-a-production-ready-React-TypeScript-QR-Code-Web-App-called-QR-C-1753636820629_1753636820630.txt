You're continuing development of a production-ready React + TypeScript QR Code Web App called **QR Code Studio**. The base UI is mostly in place with glassmorphism styling, but several parts are broken or incomplete. Please revise and complete the following:

---

ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY GOAL: 
Make QR Code Studio fully functional and polished. Users should be able to:
- Select a content type (Text, URL, WiFi, Contact, etc.)
- Input content dynamically
- Customize color, size, overlays
- Live-preview the correct QR code
- Export as PNG or SVG
- Share via generated short links

---

ðŸ”§ MUST FIX:

1. **QR Code is broken visually and structurally**
   - QR canvas does not render valid scannable codes
   - Fix `qr-generator.ts` logic, especially `modules[][]`, `setupPatterns()`, and `isDark()`
   - Use a working fallback QR generation method if needed (e.g. `qrcode-generator` or `qr-code-styling`)

2. **QRPreview.tsx is incomplete**
   - Fix rendering errors, canvas glitches, and alignments
   - Add error boundary for bad QR data
   - Match border radius and preview box style with rest of UI

3. **QR Content input and preview donâ€™t stay in sync**
   - Ensure form data updates trigger real-time QR generation
   - Fix useEffect or callback handling

4. **Customization doesn't apply visually**
   - Foreground and background colors donâ€™t update preview
   - Overlay logos donâ€™t render properly or are missing
   - Text overlays don't show under QR

5. **Sharing functionality**
   - Clicking "Create Share Link" should generate a unique link, store the QR config to backend/localStorage, and show confirmation toast
   - Shared page must show a valid static QR with title and config

---

ðŸŒŸ BONUS REQUESTS:

- Fix spacing and layout responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Make the theme toggle more visually appealing and store theme in localStorage
- Polish animations, hover effects, and CTA buttons
- Add loading indicators where needed
- Show error toasts if generation fails (especially for long vCard or WiFi formats)
- Show QR type capacity limits based on mode/version

---

Use clear modular code, React best practices, and ensure a working version by end of this session.
